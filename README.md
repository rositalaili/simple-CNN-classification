# CNN for Image Classification 

This repository contains the implementation of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model in image classification tasks. The datasets used include two public datasets, namely [MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset) and [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). Model implementation includes two processes, namely training and testing interactively. 

Code image augmentation discusses simple augmentation of [MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset) image data which includes: ZCA whitening, random rotations, random shifts, and random flips.
